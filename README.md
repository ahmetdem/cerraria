# Cerraria
This project focuses on exploring and implementing a terraria-like world with proper optimization techniques. 

I've done this because i have always wondered how these type of games handles millions of blocks so smoothly. 

## Prerequisites

To build and run Cerraria, you'll need:

- Make build system
- Git (for fetching dependencies)

## Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ahmetdem/cerraria.git
cd cerraria

# Build & run the project
make
```

Dependencies (raylib, Dear ImGui, and rlImGui) are automatically fetched and built during the build process. You don't need to install them manually.

## Future Progress
For the future i want to add the ability to interact with each block, which will lead to a more proper game.
